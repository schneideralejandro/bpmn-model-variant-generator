# bpmn-model-generator
A model generator of syntactically correct BPMN models used for antipattern detection that uses the [JBPT](https://github.com/jbpt/codebase "JBPT project") code library.

## Supported tasks

1. Generation of models from scratch or from an existing model.

2. The persistence of generated models as JSON files, using the [JSON in Java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java "JSON in Java package") package. Each JSON file contains the JSON representation of one BPMN model, generated by JBPT's `Process2JSON#convert(ProcessModel)`.

3. The plotting of generated models as PNG files, using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/ "Graphviz"). Each PNG file contains the representation of one BPMN model, generated by JBPT's `IOUtils#invokeDOT(String, String, String)`.

## Scope
1. Generable models contain only the following elements: _start event_, _end event_, _parallel gateway_, _exclusive gateway_, _sequence flow_ and _activity_.

2. Each generable model has one and only one start event.

3. Each generable model has one and only one end event.

4. Every flow node in the model must be reachable from the start event.

5. Every flow node in the model must reach the end event.

6. As a consequence of 4 and 5, generable models are _connected graphs_. As a consequence of 2, 3, 4 and 5 and according to JBPT, generable models are _two-terminal_.

7. Loops are not allowed.

8. Elements can only be added, not deleted.

## Installation
The required dependencies are packed as JARs under the *lib* directory with the exception of Graphviz *-necessary to use* `PNGSerializer#serialize(ProcessModel, Path)`*-*, which can be downloaded from its [official site](http://www.graphviz.org/ "Graphviz official site").

## Execution
`Launcher#main(String[])` receives an relative/absolute path as an *optional* parameter:

If no path is specified, the *root model -i.e.,* `start-event -> end-event`*-* is generated.

If a path to an existing model *-stored in a JSON file-* is specified, the application generates every supported variant from it.
